Certainly. The mathematical background of finding the great circle between two points on a sphere is rooted in spherical geometry and vector algebra. Let me break this down for you.



1. Spherical Coordinates to Cartesian Coordinates:
   First, we need to convert the spherical coordinates (longitude θ, latitude φ) of our two points to Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). For a unit sphere (radius = 1), this conversion is:
   
   x = cos(φ) * cos(θ)
   y = cos(φ) * sin(θ)
   z = sin(φ)

2. Vector Representation:
   Once we have the Cartesian coordinates, we can represent each point as a vector from the center of the sphere to the point on its surface. Let's call these vectors v1 and v2.

3. Plane of the Great Circle:
   The great circle lies on a plane that passes through the center of the sphere and both points. This plane is perpendicular to the cross product of v1 and v2.

4. Parametric Equation:
   We can represent any point on the great circle using a parametric equation:
   
   v(t) = v1 * sin((1-t)*θ) + v2 * sin(t*θ) / sin(θ)
   
   Where θ is the angle between v1 and v2, and t is a parameter that varies from 0 to 1.

5. Calculating θ:
   We can find θ using the dot product of v1 and v2:
   
   cos(θ) = v1 · v2 / (|v1| * |v2|)
   
   Since we're on a unit sphere, |v1| = |v2| = 1, so this simplifies to:
   
   cos(θ) = v1 · v2

6. Generating Points:
   To draw the great circle, we generate a series of points by varying t from 0 to 1 in the parametric equation. Each resulting vector is then normalized to ensure it lies on the sphere's surface.

In the code I provided earlier, we used a slightly different approach for simplicity:

1. We created a straight line between the two points:
   p(t) = p1 + t * (p2 - p1)

2. Then we normalized each point on this line to bring it back to the sphere's surface:
   p_normalized = radius * p / |p|

This method, while not as mathematically rigorous, provides a good approximation of the great circle for visualization purposes. It works because the normalization step projects each point of the straight line onto the sphere's surface along a radius, which closely approximates the true great circle path.

For more precise calculations, especially over longer distances on the sphere, the full parametric equation or other methods like the Haversine formula would be preferable.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this explanation?
